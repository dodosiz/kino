Kino is a popular game of luck in Greece

You choose the mode you want to play, this means how many numbers you want to play (from 1 to 12
numbers). Then, you chose from a table with numbers ranging from 1 to 80 the amount of numbers
you decided.

The computer makes then 20 random choises from these 80 numbers and depending on your correct guesses
and the amount of money you bet you win a price or nothing. 

You can win up to 1000000 euro by betting only 1 euro.

You can play a simulation of this game I made. Just drag all python files to the same folder and run
with your python compiler the file game.py
